# hq-trivia-assistant
An HQ Trivia assistant for those of us who are better with REST API's than trivia

## TODO
A lot... This is only the first commit after local development, so there's lots to come, including a more descriptive README.

* Create the rest of the README, including instructions for downloading and running the project
* Use Maven to manage dependencies
* Various refactoring
* Documentation
* Unit testing
* Enhance the guessing logic
* Framework for testing new guessing logic
